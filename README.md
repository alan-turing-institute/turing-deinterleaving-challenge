A set of utilities to support the Alan Turing Institute's  radar pulse train deinterleaving challenge, kicked off on the 15th May 2025. 

The purpose of this hackathon is to bring the radar deinterleaving community together to work on a common problem, **providing a benchmark by which new methods can be compared against.** As such, you are very welcome to join late, if you are taking part, it would be very appreciated if you **contact the organiser(s)** of the [Alan Turing Institute Machine Learning for Radio Frequency Interest Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/machine-learning-radio-frequency-applications) - Dr Victoria Nockles <vnockles@turing.ac.uk>, for our records.

## Technical Background

### Radar Pulse Deinterleaving Problem

Radar deinterleaving is a critical signal processing task in electronic warfare, surveillance, and radar signal intelligence applications. When multiple radar emitters operate simultaneously within the same electromagnetic environment, their transmitted pulses become interleaved in time, creating complex pulse trains that must be separated and attributed to their originating sources.

The radar pulse deinterleaving problem involves separating radar pulses from multiple unknown emitters present in a single recorded pulse train. This separation task is particularly challenging because:

- The number of active emitters is typically unknown a priori
- Pulse patterns may be irregular or adaptive
- Environmental factors introduce noise and measurement uncertainty
- Real-time processing constraints limit computational complexity


Let $X = \lbrace x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots,x_{n} \rbrace$ represent a pulse train containing n pulses from N unknown emitters. The deinterleaving task seeks to partition $X$ into N disjoint subsets:

$$X = \lbrace U_{1},\dots U_{N} \rbrace$$

where each subset $U_{i}$ contains all pulses originating from emitter i.

### Pulse Descriptor Words (PDWs)

A Pulse Descriptor Word (PDW) is a multi-dimensional feature vector that characterizes the measurable parameters of a radar pulse. PDWs serve as the fundamental input for deinterleaving algorithms, providing quantitative descriptions of pulse characteristics.

The standard PDW parameters used in this challenge include:

#### Time of Arrival (ToA)

- **Definition**: Timestamp when the pulse leading edge is detected
- **Units**: Microseconds ($\mu s$)
- **Significance**: Enables temporal pattern analysis and pulse repetition interval (PRI) estimation

#### Centre Frequency (CF)

- **Definition**: Carrier frequency of the radar pulse
- **Units**: Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz)
- **Significance**: Primary discriminator for frequency-agile or fixed-frequency emitters

#### Pulse Width (PW)

- **Definition**: Duration of the pulse envelope
- **Units**: Microseconds ($\mu s$)
- **Significance**: Indicates radar type and operational mode

#### Angle of Arrival (AoA)

- **Definition**: Spatial direction from which the pulse arrives
- **Units**: Degrees (°) or radians
- **Significance**: Provides spatial discrimination between emitters

#### Amplitude/Power

- **Definition**: Peak or integrated power level of the received pulse
- **Units**: Decibels (dB) or linear scale
- **Significance**: Relates to emitter power and propagation distance

### Deinterleaving Approaches

#### Traditional Methods

- **Histogram-based**: Analyze statistical distributions of PDW parameters (PRI histograms, frequency clustering)
- **Sequence-based**: Exploit temporal ordering and pattern recognition (PRI sequence matching, Markov models)
- **Clustering**: Unsupervised learning approaches (K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering)

#### Modern Deep Learning Approaches

Recent advances leverage transformer architectures for deinterleaving using metric learning approaches:

- **Sequence-to-sequence models**: Process entire pulse trains simultaneously
- **Self-attention mechanisms**: Capture long-range dependencies between pulses
- **Triplet loss training**: Optimizes embedding similarity within emitters and dissimilarity between emitters
- **Synthetic data generation**: Creates controlled training scenarios with known ground truth

Performance is typically evaluated using clustering metrics such as **V-measure** (the primary evaluation metric for this challenge), Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), and silhouette coefficients.

### Challenge Context

This challenge is inspired by recent research including "Radar Pulse Deinterleaving with Transformer Based Deep Metric Learning" (arXiv:2503.13476), which demonstrates transformer-based approaches achieving 0.882 adjusted mutual information score on synthetic radar pulse data using 5-dimensional PDWs.

## Installation

### Recommended

Create a new virtual environment e.g., with conda

```bash
conda create -n deinterleaving_challenge python=3.11
 pip
```

*Note: The package requires Python >=3.11.*

### Install the Package

Then **install** the ```turing_deinterleaving_challenge``` package with one of the following:

#### a. From PyPI (Recommended for most users)

```bash
python -m pip install turing-deinterleaving-challenge
```

#### b. From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egunn-turing/turing-deinterleaving-challenge
cd turing-deinterleaving-challenge
python -m pip install .
```

#### c. In Development Mode

If you are contributing to the codebase or editing the Jupyter notebook `demo.ipynb`, install the package in development mode:

If you are just editing the jupyter notebook demo.ipynb,

 ```pip install -e ".[demo]"```

or to install the entire codebase in development mode.

```pip install -e .```

 This means that after edits to the code, you do not have to reinstall the package. Note that, regardless any edits you make to imported classes/functions you will have to **restart the Jupyter notebook kernel.**


## Usage

See the jupyter notebook ```demo.ipynb``` for a detailed walkthrough of this codebase & the challenge data.

### Loading the Dataset

First, copy .env.example as .env

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, please [generate a huggingface token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and place it in the .env


```python
from turing_deinterleaving_challenge import DeinterleavingChallengeDataset

# Load training data
train_dataset = DeinterleavingChallengeDataset(
    subset="train",      # OR val, test
    window_length=1000,  # Optional: process data in windows
    min_emitters=2,      # Optional: filter by minimum emitter count
    max_emitters=5       # Optional: filter by maximum emitter count
)

# Access data as a numpy array samples and labels for training, evaluation etc.
data, labels = train_dataset[0]
```
